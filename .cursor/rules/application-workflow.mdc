# Job Application Workflow

## indeed_apply.py
- Reads jobs from `temp_jobs.csv` (created by scraper)
- Applies to each job using browser automation
- Handles multi-step application forms
- Uses intelligent question answering system
- Updates progress and learns from applications

## Question Answering System
- **Bank First**: Uses stored Q&A pairs for speed
- **AI Fallback**: Calls OpenRouter API for new questions
- **Learning**: Saves AI answers to `questions_bank.json`
- **Modes**: stored_only, hybrid, ai_only

## Configuration
```yaml
question_answering:
  enabled: true
  mode: "hybrid"  # stored_only | hybrid | ai_only
  on_unknown_question: "ai_then_skip"
  openrouter:
    api_key: "your_key"
    model: "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
```

## Files Used
