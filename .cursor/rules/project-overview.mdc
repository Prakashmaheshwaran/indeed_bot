# Indeed Bot - Split Architecture

## Project Structure
- **`indeed_scrape.py`** - Scrapes Indeed jobs from multiple URLs to CSV
- **`indeed_apply.py`** - Applies to jobs from CSV using question answering
- **`config.yaml`** - Configuration for URLs, timing, and question answering
- **`questions_bank.json`** - Stores Q&A pairs for application forms
- **`progress.json`** - Tracks applied/failed jobs and statistics

## Workflow
1. Configure multiple URLs in `config.yaml`
2. Run `python indeed_scrape.py` → Creates `temp_jobs.csv`
3. Run `python indeed_apply.py` → Applies to jobs from CSV

## Key Features
- Multi-URL scraping with deduplication
- Intelligent question answering (bank + AI)
- Progress tracking and resume capability
- Temporary CSV storage (wiped each scrape)
