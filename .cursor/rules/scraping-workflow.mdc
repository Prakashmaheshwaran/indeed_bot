# Job Scraping Workflow

## indeed_scrape.py
- Reads multiple URLs from `config.yaml` search.urls
- Scrapes pages `start` to `end` for each URL
- Finds jobs with "Indeed Apply" buttons only
- Deduplicates across all URLs
- Filters out already processed jobs
- Saves new jobs to `temp_jobs.csv` (wiped each run)
- Updates `progress.json` with scraping stats

## Configuration
```yaml
search:
  urls:
    - "https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=python&l=remote"
    - "https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=javascript&l=remote"
  start: 0
  end: 10  # Pages per URL
```

## Output Files
- `temp_jobs.csv` - Job URLs, IDs, and scrape timestamps
- `progress.json` - Updated with scraping statistics
